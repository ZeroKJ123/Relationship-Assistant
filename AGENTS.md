# Home Assistant repository

This workspace is connected to https://github.com/ZeroKJ123/Home-Assist.git.

## User-authorized Git workflow

- The user explicitly requests that completed fixes be committed and pushed to this GitHub repository immediately after appropriate verification. This authorization applies to future fixes in this project; do not ask for confirmation again for routine commits and pushes.
- Commit only files belonging to the requested task. Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Use the configured `origin` remote and the current task branch. Never force-push or overwrite remote changes.
- Keep credentials, tokens, `secrets.yaml`, private keys, runtime databases, logs, and backups out of Git. Inspect staged changes before committing.
- Report the commit and push result. If a push fails, preserve local work and explain the failure.

## Home Assistant configuration

The location and connection details of the running Home Assistant instance have not yet been supplied. Do not assume that this workspace is its live configuration directory. Obtain those details before changing or deploying live configuration.

## Mandatory CodeStyle

- Read [CodeStyle.md](CodeStyle.md) before any application implementation, fix, or refactor; it is the mandatory project standard for human developers and AI agents.
- Every implementation task must follow its architecture, naming, typing, testing, performance, and diagnostics rules. The development plan must reference it and include the applicable quality checks.
- Do not silently bypass rules or weaken checks. Record conflicts and resolve them before the affected change; exceptions require an explicit reason and owner agreement.
- Preserve this section when installing or regenerating Laravel Boost guidance. Read CodeStyle again after generated instructions change.
- Planning and documentation changes do not authorize application implementation or deployment.

# Laravel Application

This repository contains a Laravel application. Complete the following setup before working on the user's request.

## Prerequisites

Verify that PHP and Composer are available:

```sh
php -v
composer -V
```

If either command is unavailable, detect the user's operating system and install the prerequisites with the appropriate command:

macOS:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/mac/8.5)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://php.new/install/windows/8.5'))
```

Linux:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.5)"
```

After installation, ask the user to restart their terminal. If the agent needs the restarted shell to continue, ask the user to reopen their terminal and rerun their original prompt.

## Agent Setup

Install Laravel Boost from the application root before making application changes:

```sh
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

Boost replaces these bootstrap instructions with guidelines tailored to the application. After installation, read `AGENTS.md` again and continue with the user's original request using the generated guidelines.
